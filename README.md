## Project Description
Explain what the project is for, what problems it solves, and its main features.
This project provides a configurable DNS resolver environment using Docker, potentially with Tinyproxy for HTTP/HTTPS proxying.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation
Step-by-step instructions with commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
cd your-project-name
docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage
Basic usage examples. For applications, commands or interface screenshots.

To use the DNS resolver, configure your system or application to use the IP address of the Docker host on port 53 (or the port mapped in `docker-compose.yml`).

If Tinyproxy is used, configure your browser or system to use the proxy on the port specified in `data/tinyproxy.conf` (e.g., 8888).
